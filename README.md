# Sharshooter

My first game written in Ruby, using the Gosu 2D engine.

The explosion animation tiles are taken from: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/205929/?page=1#post-2068717

To play:

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libpango1.0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile-dev libmpg123-dev
bundle install
bundle exec ruby game.rb
```
